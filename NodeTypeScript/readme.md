## About Indexing

- Just added in Scheme => index: { background: true, unique: true }

## About Deployment in heroku

   As in development environment the typescript is converted into js by the compiler
   but for the production environment we have to convert it into javascript.

   To Convert to js write in package.json

- "create-bundle" : "tsc && node dist/index.js"
- "start" : "node dist/index.js"

## To Check with LoadTest

- npm i loadtest
  -loadtest [-n requests] [-c concurrency] [-k] URL
  -loadtest -n 100 -c 20 -k "<https://node-ts-blog.herokuapp.com/api/user/login>"
